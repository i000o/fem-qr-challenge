## Overview

For my first Frontend Mentor project, I had to design a static web page with a QR-code.

## My process

:alien: First, I noted down all the elements I could see in the Figma design including an image, h1, h2 and section and organised them into HTML tags.
Then, I inserted these into the HTML body content.
Next, I began to style with CSS one section at a time. The most challenging part was getting used to CSS Grid, and then writing media queries for responsive design and the mobile version.
Finally, I submitted changes via Git.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and Flex
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing I learned had to do with Grid layouts in CSS.

For a long time, I couldn't get my alignment right because I had defined the grid with a repeat function that used fr units. This meant that the browser split my grid into the available space, meaning it wasn't a fixed grid and would change based on the viewport, which made aligning items difficult.

ADD CODE SNIPPET HERE

Once I measured that each track should be 64px in width, the grid was able to be centre-aligned both along main and cross axis so that I could then begin optimising for mobile. To centre align, I used align-content and justify-content. I had tried margin: auto but found this not to be helpful due to its consideration of 'available space'. I learnt the importance of using align-content, not align-items and respectively, with justify. I'd like to practice grid layouts a lot more because I find them incredibly useful as a visual person.

ADD CODE SNIPPET

My next challenge came with media queries. It had been a while since I had gone over them. I took a desktop-first approach and used max-width values. I used Chrome dev tools to help me visualise. I wanted the QR code to stay in position down to mobile at 375px, but I had to adjust the grid-column values to ensure that the grid sized down proportionally so the .card stayed in the same place as the viewport width reduced. Something that clicked into place was that before, I was applying width values that matched the viewport to the grid container, because I wanted it to take up the space rather than shrink. But, I learnt that if I used width: 100% instead, this snapping would stop happening when I sized the viewport down. I don't quite understand why this is, but logically, it makes sense that I should be able to just tell the browser that the grid should take up all the viewport space rather than remain stuck at its max width setting. I suppose this meant that any value below the max width would cause the grid to collapse back to its unresponsive design and shrink smaller and smaller, unhelpfully.

ADD CODE SNIPPET

I enjoyed getting into a nice flow trialling different solutions and speedily googling questions I had along the way to piece together my understanding of what I did and did not need in my code. It was fun.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I'd like to use my learnings from this challeneg to focus on developing my understanding of CSS Layouts. I have been going over float, flexbox and grid but I can sense how useful a 12-column grid system must be for web designs and I'd really like to master these. Conceptually, once I understand them well and can apply them to different situations, I think I will really come to enjoy them more and more.

I'm glad I got to practice using media queries in this challenge. When I originally learnt about them, it seems somewhat straightforward, but making decisions about breakpoints was harder than I thought. I'm not sure if my code includes too many media queries as it stands, at five. I'd like to practice responsive design more and more with these, too.
